        Returns true if adding a mainbridge peer is done successfully.
        
        The childOperator method adds a new remote node to the peer list. The node will try to maintain connectivity to these nodes at all times, reconnecting every once in a while if the remote connection goes down.
        
        The method accepts a single argument, the kni URL of the remote peer to start tracking and returns a BOOL indicating whether the peer was accepted for tracking or some error occurred.
