        **NOTE:** This API replaces admin_stopRPC. The admin_stopRPC will be deprecated soon.

        The stopHTTP is an administrative method that closes the currently open HTTP RPC endpoint. As the node can only have a single HTTP endpoint running, this method takes no parameters, returning a boolean whether the endpoint was closed or not.

        **JSONRPC:** `admin_stopHTTP`
