        Returns the structured logs created during the execution of EVM between two blocks (including start) as a JSON object. That is, the result of tracing for a total of end-start+1 blocks is returned.

        **NOTE:** Don't trace too many blocks at the same time as it can overuse machine resources.

        **JSONRPC:** `debug_traceBlockByNumberRange`
